;;; Commentary:

;; Combine find-cmd with eproject to define your eproject files.
;;
;; For large projects, eproject-extras will sometimes try to construct very
;; long command line strings that bash cannot handle. e.g.:
;;
;;     /bin/bash: /usr/bin/grep: Argument list too long
;;     Grep exited abnormally with code 126 ...
;;
;; This seems mostly due to use of the eproject-list-project-files* related
;; functions, which can build very long strings.
;;
;; As an alternative, using find provides a way to operate/use a project's file
;; list for many "extras" while still maintaining many other core eproject
;; usefulness.
;;
;; To use eproject-find-cmd, your project definition must contain the attribute
;; :find-cmd-sexp, which is an sexp for find-cmd specifying the project's
;; files.  For example, if you'd like a project defined to be all *.c and *.h files:
;;
;;     (define-project-type find-cmd-ch-project (generic)
;;       (look-for ".find-cmd-ch-project")
;;       :find-cmd-sexp (and (type "f") (or (name "*.h") (name "*.c"))))

;;; Code:

(require 'find-cmd)

;; This is a work around.  find-cmd tries to put (expand-file-name
;; default-directory) on the command line, but that results in find-grep output
;; having long absolute pathname matches.  See
;; eproject-find-cmd-custom-find-grep.
