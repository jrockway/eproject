;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Eproject is an extension that lets you group related files together
;; as projects.  It aims to be as unobtrusive as possible -- no new
;; files are created (or required to exist) on disk, and buffers that
;; aren't a member of a project are not affected in any way.
;;
;; The main starting point for eproject is defining project types.
;; There is a macro for this, define-project-type, that accepts four
;; arguments, the type name (a symbol), a list of supertypes (for
;; inheriting properties), a form that is executed to determine
;; whether a file is a member of a project, and then a free-form
;; property list.  An example will clear things up.
;;
;; Let's create a "perl" project type, for Perl projects that have a
;; Makefile.PL.
;;
;; (define-project-type perl (generic)
;;   (look-for "Makefile.PL")
;;   :relevant-files ("\\.pm$" "\\.t$"))
;;
;; Now when you open a file and somewhere above in the directory tree
;; there is a Makefile.PL, it will be a "perl project".
;;
;; There are a few things you get with this.  A hook called
;; perl-project-file-visit-hook will be run, and the buffer will have
;; the "eproject-mode" minor-mode turned on.  You can also read and
;; set metadata via the eproject-attribute and
;; eproject-add-project-metadatum calls.
;;
;; (This is mostly helpful to Lisp programmers rather than end-users;
;; if you want tools for visiting and managing projects (and ibuffer
;; integration), load `eproject-extras'.  These extras are great
;; examples of the eproject API in action, so please take a look even
;; if you don't want those exact features.)
;;
;; Let's look at the mechanics of the define-project-type call.  The
;; first argument is the name of the project type -- it can be any
;; symbol.  The next argument is a list of other projects types that
;; this project will inherit from.  That means that if you call
;; eproject-get-project-metadatum and the current project doesn't
;; define a value, we'll look at the supertypes until we get something
;; non-nil.  Usually you will want to set this to (generic), which
;; will make your type work correctly even if you don't define any of
;; your own metadata.
;;
;; The next argument is a form that will be executed with the filename
;; that was just opened bound to FILE.  It is expected to return the
;; project root, or nil if FILE is not in a project of this type.  The
;; look-for function will look up the directory tree for a file that
;; is named the same as its argument (see the docstring for
;; `eproject--look-for-impl' for all the details).  You can write any
;; Lisp here you like; we'll see some more examples later.  (You only
;; get one form, so if you need to execute more than one, just wrap it
;; in a progn.)
;;
;; The final (&rest-style) argument is a property list of initial project
;; metadata.  You can put anything you want here, as long as it is in the
;; form of a property list (keyword, value, keyword, value, ...).
;;
;; After this form runs, eproject will be able to recognize files in
;; the type of the project you defined.  It also creates a hook named
;; <type>-project-file-visit-hook.  You can do anything you want here,
;; including access (eproject-type) and (eproject-root).
;;
;; As an example, in my perl-project-file-visit-hook, I do this:
;;
;; (lambda ()
;;   (ignore-errors
;;     (stylish-repl-eval-perl
;;      (format "use lib '%s'" (car (perl-project-includes)))))))
;;
;; This will add the library directory of this project to my current
;; stylish-repl session, so that I can use my project in the REPL
;; immediately.  (I do something similar for Lisp + SLIME projects)
;;
;; That's basically all there is.  eproject is designed to be minimal and
;; extensible, so I hope it meets your needs.
;;
;; Please e-mail me or find me on #emacs (jrockway) if you have
;; questions.  If you'd like to send a patch (always appreciated),
;; please diff against the latest git version, available by running:
;;
;; $ git clone git://github.com/jrockway/eproject
;;
;; Share and enjoy.

;;; Public API:

;; eproject-root (&optional buffer)
;;
;; - returns the project root for the project that buffer is a member
;;   of. defaults to the current buffer

;; eproject-attribute (key &optional root)
;;
;; - returns the value of key for the project that buffer is a member
;;   of.  root defaults to the current buffer's eproject-root

;; eproject-list-project-files

;; define-project-type

;; define-project-attribute

;; eproject-projects

;; Everything else is mostly used internally, and may change.

;;; Public commands:

;; eproject-maybe-turn-on
;;
;; - turn on eproject for the current buffer, if possible
;;   (if it's turned on, the hooks will be run)

;; eproject-reinitialize-project
;;
;; - re-read config for the current project, then run
;;   eproject-maybe-turn-on
;;
;;   this is bound to C-c C-c when editing .eproject files, which is
;;   very convenient for testing.

;; See eproject-extras.el for more interesting / useful commands.
;; This file is mostly "plumbing".

;;; Bugs:
;;
;; You can't forward reference supertypes -- this will mess things up
;; internally, but you won't get a warning.  This can be easily fixed
;; by using a smarter algorithm for eproject--all-types.
;;
;; The "linearized isa" (i.e. "class precedence list") is computed
;; with a depth-first search.  This is bad; we should really use the
;; C3 ordering.
