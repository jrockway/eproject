;;; Commentary:

;; Some of this stuff used to be in eproject "core", but it is a bit
;; bloated, and not strictly necessary.  So now it lives here, leaving
;; the eproject core pristine and minimal.

;;; History:

;; 2012-05-16: `eproject-compile' moved to contrib/eproject-compile.el.

;;; Code:

(require 'eproject)
(require 'cl)
(require 'iswitchb)
(require 'ibuffer)
(require 'ibuf-ext)
